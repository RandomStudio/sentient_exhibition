# The Sentient Exhibition

Like living creatures, images can change, adapt, and transform.  
Here, two possible mutations emerge from a single form.  
Your choice decides which vision survives â€” the other fades away.  
With every vote, you shape an evolution of images.  
The artwork is never fixed, but always becoming.

Press one of the two buttons to guide the next mutation.
